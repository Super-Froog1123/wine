                            <p>Oktoberfest, the world-renowned festival celebrating beer in Germany was celebrated by people from all over the world in October this year. However, the scene has quietly changed as more and more people cheer for a sober celebration.</p>
                            <p>Alcohol-free options are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/oktoberfest-alcoholfree-beer-munich-e1279f6e24f406fa04ead4b09f4bbcbe">rising in popularity at Oktoberfest</a>. With more breweries offering non-alcoholic varieties, attendees enjoyed the festive atmosphere without the hangover. This shift reflects a broader trend in Germany, where beer consumption is declining, yet the demand for flavorful, alcohol-free alternatives continues to grow. </p>
                            <p>Among 35 tents in Oktoberfest, there were only two tents that did not provide alcohol-free beer.</p>

                                <p>As health consciousness rises, more consumers are favoring these non-alcoholic beverages, creating new growth opportunities for the transformation of the alcoholic beverage market.</p>

                            <p>This trend shows that non-alcoholic beverages are becoming a mainstream choice. Consumer demand is rising, and these drinks are gaining market share compared to traditional alcoholic beverages and favoring consumers. </p>
                            <p>The increase in sales indicates that companies are actively expanding into the non-alcoholic sector, launching innovative products to meet demand.

                        <p>As for the replacement of alcohol, except for non-alcoholic beverages, there are also a variety of choices in mocktails. </p>
                        <p>“Mocktails” is the blend of “mock” and “cocktail”, which also means fake cocktail as known as an alcohol-free cocktail. Although some might think the only difference is the content of alcohol, they differ from each other in many other ways.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>From the perspective of alcohol content, mocktails have less alcohol than cocktails. As the meaning of mocktail shows, it contains almost zero alcohol. According to the standard of mocktail, a beer with an alcohol content of less than or equal to 0.5% can be called mocktail. However, for cocktails, it generally contains more than 4% alcohol.</p>
                        <p>When making mocktails and cocktails, people will choose different materials. Bartenders often use fresh juices, carbonated water, herbs, and spices to make mocktails, which can emphasize natural flavors and freshness without involving fermentation.</p>
                        <p>On the other side, cocktails are typically made from fermented ingredients such as grains (for beer), grapes (for wine), or other fruits (for spirits). The use of different materials also providesdifferent flavors and tastes.</p>
                        <p>For making cocktails, people need to do fermentation and distillation, and wait for a long time, which is ranging from weeks to years, to get a bottle of wine that tastes great. However, if we want to get a cup of mocktail, what the bartender needs to do is to just mix all kinds of juices and water, then cool and garnish them.</p>

                           <p>A long time ago, people hailed alcohol for its health benefits. They think that drinking wine is beneficial for their bodies, even though there was  little scientific research back on the saying.</p>
                           <p>The most well-known idea is that drinking wine can bring better cardiovascular health. Some believe that drinking red wine can help to boost heart, brain and gut health.</p>
                           <p>It can also be helpful for reducing risk in cardiovascular diseases, and there are many people believing that consuming a certain amount of alcohol helps to decrease blood clotting and enhance mental well-being.</p>
                           <p>However, WHO has published a new article about alcohol consumption. It said that when it comes to alcohol consumption, there is no safe amount that does not affect health.</p>

                            <h2>No level of alcohol is safe for your body</h2>
                            <p>According to <a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health">WHO</a>, there is no safe level of alcohol consumption, underscoring the serious health risks associated with drinking.</p>
                            <p>This declaration follows a comprehensive evaluation of the dangers linked to alcohol, which has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen—an acknowledgment that places it alongside notorious substances such as tobacco and asbestos. </p>
                            <p>The finding reveals that alcohol is responsible for at least seven types of cancer, including some of the most common forms such as breast and bowel cancer. Even moderate drinking—defined as less than 1.5 liters of wine or 3.5 liters of beer per week—can significantly increase the likelihood of developing alcohol-related cancers.</p>
                            <p>“The only certainty is that the more you drink, the more harmful it is. Conversely, the less you drink, the safer it is,” said Dr. Carina Ferreira-Borges, a leading figure in the WHO's Noncommunicable Disease Management unit.</p>

The consumption of alcohol can cause harm to our whole body from head to even bones.</p>
                            <p>The harms include brain function impaired, heart health at risk, liver damage, pancreatitis threat, cancer risks elevated, weakened immune system.</p>

                            <p>According to research by Market.Us Madie, different age groups are primarily turning to non-alcoholic beverages for the following two reasons:
                            </p>

                            <h3>High Health Awareness</h3>

                            <p>The pursuit of a healthy lifestyle has become a common goal across all age groups. Ranging from 41% of Gen  Z to 52% of Boomers, consumers are increasingly focused on nutritional content and the impact of products on their health. 
                            </p>

                            <p>They seek non-alcoholic beverages to maintain physical and mental well-being. Particularly among Boomers and Gen X, there is a stronger emphasis on healthy living, making non-alcoholic drinks more popular among these younger groups.
                            </p>

                            <p>“Alcohol is just like a type of drug,” said Léane Amelie Gendraud, 19, who is a French student studying at Hong Kong Baptist University. She does not drink alcohol and chooses to drink mocktail when she goes to bars with friends. 
                            </p>

                            <p>“I have the chance to have friends who don't pressure me to drink alcohol, so I am grateful for that because I know it’s not the same case for everyone,” said Léane .
                            </p>

                            <p>Born in a country that is famous for its wine culture, Léane has witnessed the promotion of drinking such as wine association, wine club, and wine tasting class.“I would be more pressured in France rather than in Hong Kong to drink alcohol.”
                            </p>

                            <p>“I believe by having such associations and such clubs, it just kinda makes the consumption of alcohol like a normal thing and some people encourage it while I don’t believe so,” she said.
                            </p>

                            <p>Reducing alcohol consumption is also an important component of this trend. Up to 54% of Generation Z consumers indicate that controlling their alcohol intake is a primary motivation for choosing non-alcoholic beverages. This reflects their concern about the potential harms of alcohol and their desire to stay sober in social settings to better engage in interactions and control their behavior.
                            </p>

                            <h3>New Flavor Experience</h3>
                            <p>In addition to health factors, taste experience is an important consideration for choosing non-alcoholic beverages. Generation X and Millennials, in particular, have a strong demand for flavor and personal preferences, exceeding 40%. 
                            </p>

                            <p>This indicates that these consumers believe non-alcoholic drinks offer an unprecedented freshness and enjoyable drinking experience while avoiding the negative effects of alcohol.

                            <h2>The New Trend</h2>
                            
                            <p>As non-alcoholic beverages continue to rise in popularity, they are reshaping the way people approach social drinking and healthy living. Campaigns like “Dry January”, which challenge participants to abstain from alcohol for an entire month, have brought this trend into the spotlight, encouraging millions to reflect on their relationship with alcohol and explore alternatives. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Meanwhile, the sober curious movement invites individuals to question the role of alcohol in their lives without necessarily committing to complete abstinence. 
                            </p>

                            <p>These cultural shifts signal a broader rethinking of drinking norms, with non-alcoholic options no longer seen as compromises but as sophisticated and health-conscious choices. 
                            </p>

                            <p>“Whether it's a zero-proof craft cocktail at a trendy bar or an alcohol-free beer at a casual gathering, the world is embracing beverages that cater to both taste and well-being.
